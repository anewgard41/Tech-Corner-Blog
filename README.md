# Tech-Corner-Blog

## Description

Welcome to the Tech Corner! A blog about technology, programming, and everything in between. This blog is a CMS-style blog site similar to a Wordpress site, where developers can publish their blog posts and comment on other developersâ€™ posts as well. This application follows the MVC paradigm in its architectural structure, using Handlebars.js as the templating language, Sequelize as the ORM, and the express-session npm package for authentication. Express.js is also used to handle routing and the app is deployed to Heroku.

Here is a screenshot of the homepage:
